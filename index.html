    <h2>Why Accountability is Hard for People with ADHD</h2>
    <p class="subtitle">(and It’s Not Your Fault)</p>
    <p class="description">
        If you’ve ever felt like you can’t stay consistent, no matter how hard you try, you’re not alone. People with ADHD often struggle with accountability, not because they’re lazy or unmotivated, but because ADHD fundamentally affects how the brain manages planning, organization, and self-regulation.</p>
    <div class="adhd-challenges-container">
        <!-- Challenge 1 -->
        <div class="adhd-challenges-card">
            <img src="img/calendar.png" alt="Personalized Goal Setting" class="service-image">
            <strong>Time Blindness:</strong> Struggling to gauge how long things will take or forgetting deadlines until they’re suddenly looming? That’s time blindness. It’s not about being careless—it’s your brain struggling to perceive time accurately.
        </div>
        <!-- Challenge 2 -->
        <div class="adhd-challenges-card">
            <img src="img/procrastinating.png" alt="Personalized Goal Setting" class="service-image">
            <strong>Procrastination:</strong> More than just putting things off, it’s often a response to tasks that feel overwhelming or boring. ADHD brains crave stimulation, so less exciting tasks get pushed aside—no matter how important they are.
        </div>
        <!-- Challenge 3 -->
        <div class="adhd-challenges-card">
            <img src="img/heart.png" alt="Personalized Goal Setting" class="service-image">
            <strong>Impulsivity:</strong> The ADHD brain is wired for instant gratification, which can lead to impulsive decisions that derail your plans. It’s not that you don’t care—it’s that your brain responds to the here and now.
        </div>
        <!-- Challenge 4 -->
        <div class="adhd-challenges-card">
            <img src="img/emotional.png" alt="Personalized Goal Setting" class="service-image">
            <strong>Emotional Regulation:</strong> Anxiety, perfectionism, and fear of failure can create a cycle of avoidance. If you’ve ever been paralyzed by the thought of starting a project, that’s your ADHD brain trying to protect you from stress.
        </div>
        <!-- Challenge 5 -->
        <div class="adhd-challenges-card">
            <img src="img/fluctuate.png" alt="Personalized Goal Setting" class="service-image">
            <strong>Inconsistent Motivation:</strong> ADHD often relies on interest-based motivation, which can fluctuate wildly. It’s not that you don’t want to get things done; it’s that your brain isn’t wired to sustain focus without that spark.

        <h2>Why External Accountability Works for ADHD Brains</h2>
        <p class="subtitle">And How an Accountability Partner Can Help</p>
        <p class="description">Staying consistent can be one of the hardest parts of life with ADHD. Our brains struggle with executive functions like planning, prioritizing, and follow-through—and internal motivation often isn’t enough to get things done. That’s where external accountability comes in.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="accountability-container">
        <!-- Service 1 -->
        <div class="accountability-card">
            <img src="img/steps.png" alt="Personalized Goal Setting" class="service-image">
            <h3>Structure Makes the Invisible Visible</h3>
            <p>ADHD brains thrive on structure but often struggle to create it independently. External accountability adds clarity and turns your abstract goals into achievable, actionable steps.</p>
        </div>
        <!-- Service 2 -->
        <div class="accountability-card">
            <img src="img/motivation.png" alt="Action Planning" class="service-image">
            <h3>Encouragement Fuels Motivation</h3>
            <p>ADHD often comes with inconsistent motivation. A partner cheering you on, celebrating your wins, and supporting you through struggles provides the extra push you need to follow through.</p>
        </div>
        <!-- Service 3 -->
        <div class="accountability-card">
            <img src="img/process.png" alt="Progress Review" class="service-image">
            <h3>Reduces Overwhelm and Procrastination</h3>
            <p>Big tasks or boring ones? Both can feel paralyzing. With external accountability, you’ll break them into smaller, manageable pieces and start tackling them one step at a time.</p>
        </div>
        <!-- Service 4 -->
        <div class="accountability-card">
            <img src="img/high-five.png" alt="Email Support" class="service-image">
            <h3>Creates Positive Pressure</h3>
            <p>Sometimes, knowing someone’s in your corner (and will check in) is all the nudge you need to stay on track. External accountability offers that gentle, judgment-free pressure to keep moving forward.</p>
        </div>
        <!-- Service 5 -->
        <div class="accountability-card">
            <img src="img/self-confidence.png" alt="Text Support" class="service-image">
            <h3>Builds Momentum and Confidence</h3>
            <p>Small wins build big momentum. As you stay consistent, you’ll feel more in control and confident in your ability to get things done—one week at a time.</p>

            <h3>Simplifies Decision-Making</h3>
            <p>ADHD brains often struggle with prioritization. A second perspective—like mine—helps cut through the noise, so you can focus on what truly matters and stop spinning your wheels.</p>
